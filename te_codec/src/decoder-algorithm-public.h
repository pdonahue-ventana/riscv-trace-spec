 * There is a relatively high cost of calling the function get_instr(),

 *  1) retrieve an instruction from an Elf binary (for a given address)
 *  2) decode the retrieved instruction (using riscv-disassembler)
 *  3) generate a human-friendly disassembly line to be printed
 * This function is potentially called multiple times each time the PC
 * is advanced. For S/W efficiency reasons, it is worth the effort to
 * minimize the cost of all these calls. This is especially the case
 * when the trace-decoder is reconstructing the execution of a loop, as
 * the get_instr() function will be called with the exact same values
 * many times in short succession. The chosen solution is a pure software
 * cache, which does not map on to the trace encoder hardware at all.
 *
 * We create a simple (direct-mapped) cache of recent instruction decodes,
 * using the array decoded_cache[] in the te_decoder_state_t structure.
 * This will hold 100% of the slots with 16-bit instructions, but only
 * 50% of the slots with 32-bit instructions, etcetera. As the "index"
 * is the bottom n-bits of the address (after shifting it right by one).
 *
 * We now define a few macros to dimension and map this decode cache.
 * Note: a cache size of 2^10 resulted in a hit-rate of 99.12% for coremark!
